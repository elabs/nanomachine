# Nanomachine

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elabs/nanomachine.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/elabs/nanomachine)

A really tiny state machine for ruby. No events, only accepted transitions and transition callbacks.

The difference between Nanomachine, and otherwise known Micromachine (https://rubygems.org/gems/micromachine) is that
Micromachine transitions to new states in response to events; multiple events can transition between the two same states.
Nanomachine, on the other hand, does not care about events, and only needs the state you want to be in after successful
transition.

Nanomachine can be used in any ruby project, and have no runtime dependencies.

## Installation

Install the gem:

```shell
gem install nanomachine
```

or add it to your Gemfile, if you are using [Bundler][]:

```ruby
gem "nanomachine", "~> 1.0"
```

[Bundler]: http://gembundler.com/

## Example

```ruby
state_machine = Nanomachine.new("unpublished") do |fsm|
  fsm.transition("published", %w[unpublished processing removed])
  fsm.transition("unpublished", %w[published processing removed])
  fsm.transition("processing", %w[published unpublished])
  fsm.transition("removed", []) # defined for being explicit

  fsm.on_transition(:to => "processing") do |(previous_state, _), id|
    Worker.schedule(id, previous_state)
  end

  fsm.on_transition do |(from_state, to_state)|
    update_column(:state, to_state)
  end
end

if state_machine.transition_to("published")
  puts "Publish success!"
else
  puts "Publish failure! Weâ€™re in #{state_machine.state}."
end
```
